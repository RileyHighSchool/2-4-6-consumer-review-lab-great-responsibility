Makes 12 cups and doesn’t leak. I broke the coffee screen plastic on the second day tapping it with a spoon to clean. Don’t do that. It hasn’t really affected the brew so just kind of letting it go.

No leaks, no timer, manual on off switch is old school but I’m fine with it. I brewed my first 12 cup brew this weekend and it tasted great.

Simple and effective.
