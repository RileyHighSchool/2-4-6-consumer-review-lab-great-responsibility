The *glass part arrived with a small manufacturing *error making it *super *brittle to torque while screwing on the top. It broke while I was putting on the lid, so I contacted the seller. They forwarded the report to their factory to see if they could future proof the product, while they sending me another one for free. They were extremely *reasonable, *quick, and *polite.

Now that I've gotten a chance to use the *replacement spray bottle, I'm very *happy with it. It spreads oil in the pan very *evenly without having to use much, protecting the pan and making it *easy to cook the food *without *hassle. I'm *impressed.
